The idea is to recreate some unix commands in Haskell, but probably a bit more bare
bones than the real ones.

To invoke the unix comman, the first argument is the command, and the remaining
are the args to that command.

E.g. unixutils cat 1.txt 2.txt

1. cat

This will "concatenate files and print on the standard output" as per man page.
Except ... that is all it will do so no "cat -v" or similar options.

So it will take alist of files as arguments, and then read from those files in
that order and direct the exact same stream of bytes to the standard output.

E.g. unixutils cat 1.txt 2.txt

2. grep

To be specified....

3. ls

To be specified....

4. rm

To be specified....
